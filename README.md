# My ghostty config

This is my local config for [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

## Install

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for the installation.

```bash
just install
```

Considering `ghostty` is already installed, you can just run:

```bash
just config
```
